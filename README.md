# web-app-java

+ I'm changing my stack to Java/JavaScript because Python has to many ways to follow, but it's more requested when make uses of Web Scraping, RPA and Data Analysis, that I do not have any intention to have a Job on theses skills, of course I'll learn about those for personal enrichment, but nothing professionally, because my goal now is to create websites and softwares apps, also a little of iOS/Android apps.

This repository has an training value, my Java's course on Udemy website is offering this experience to create a basic CRUD web application. The API used is Spring Boot 2.0, using generated Maven Project on VS Code implemented with NoSQL Database, MongoDB, to save my data requests.

You can find the installation process for Windows and macOS in any kind of Google research, but for Linux Ubuntu 20.14, that I'm using for this repository, follow theses steps:

Once you have java jdk installed, type on your terminal:

java -version
sudo apt-get install maven

I'm also using Visual Studio Code, and creating a Maven project in this IDE it is a little bit harder then using Eclipse. So, you can search and download in your Extension (Ctrl+Shift+X) for:

Extension Pack For Java
Spring Boot Dashboard (if it doesn't auto download the others Spring Extension, download those manually)

Then you create a SPRING BOOT, not MAVEN project, using Java Overview.
